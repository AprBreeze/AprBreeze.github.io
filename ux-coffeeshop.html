                        <p>This project showcases the research and design of the Information Architecture (IA) for an online coffee shop and developed two wireframe concepts using the insights from the research.</p>
                        <p><br>The process began with a competitive analysis of existing coffee e-commerce sites to identify common design patterns and user expectations. I then conducted card sorting studies to inform the navigation, translating user mental models into a clear site structure.</p>
                        <p><br>Based on these insights into customer needs and preferences, I developed two wireframe concepts representing different navigation approaches. These concepts served as a foundation for a potential A/B test, with the feedback from both providing complementary insights.</p>
                        <p><br>The final deliverable is a user-centric, accessible website structure that enhances the customer experience for browsing coffee and related products. The project concludes with a detailed design rationale justifying all strategic IA and prototyping choices.</p>

                        <h3>Navigation</h3>
                        <p>Most online coffee retailers rely on a standardized global navigation structure that prioritizes core offerings like coffee, subscriptions, and workshops. Given their frequent collaboration with caf√©s and other retailers, "Wholesale" and "Contact" also consistently feature as high-level navigation categories.</p>

                        <p><br>A two-layer navigation system is a nearly universal design pattern across the analyzed websites. The first layer establishes broad categories, such as Coffee and Coffee Gear, while the second layer provides immediate access to specific subcategories. For instance, Coffee is typically subdivided by flavor and origin, and Coffee Gear includes items like filter paper and milk pitchers.</p>

                        <h3 style="padding-top: 3rem;">Search</h3>
                        <p>Search functionality is consistently present but is narrowly scoped for quick, transactional product retrieval, avoiding unnecessary complexity.</p>

                        <h3 style="padding-top: 3rem;">Display of Navigatio Hierarchy </h3>
                        <p>Finally, the display of the navigation hierarchy varies: some sites employ integrated dropdown menus (e.g., De Mello) for simultaneous access to primary and secondary links, while others use a progressive disclosure model (e.g., Hatch Specialty) where secondary navigation only appears after the primary category is selected.</p>

                </div>
                    <div style="flex: 1; margin-left: 2rem;">
                        <h3>Methods</h3>
                        <p>I conducted two Card Sorting studies to inform the website's Information Architecture (IA).</p>
                        <p><br>The first was an open sort to establish users' mental models for product classification, guiding the design of secondary categories. The second was a closed sort to validate the global navigation, using eight predefined categories selected through competitive analysis (e.g., Shop Coffee, Subscription, Wholesale). This combined approach ensured both user-driven insights and market alignment for the final structure.</p>
                        <h3 style="padding-top: 3rem;">Result - Open Sort</h3>
                        <p>The study results demonstrated a high level of clarity in user understanding of coffee-related categories. Participants generally sorted cards correctly, confirming the intuitive relationship between the proposed global and secondary navigation items. This suggests that the established categories will enable users to quickly and effectively locate desired products and information.</p>
                        <div class ="image-container">
                            <img src="image/coffee/card-sort.png" alt="card-sort-result-1">

                        <h3 style="padding-top: 3rem;">Result - Closed Sort</h3>
                        <p>The open card sort revealed an area of low consensus regarding the secondary navigation structure. Although the best merge method showed 67% agreement on general categories, flavor-related descriptors (chocolate, bright, fruity, floral) were sorted inconsistently across the user group.</p>
                            <p><br>This inconsistency suggests that a significant portion of the user base (likely those with lower coffee consumption) may lack the coffee knowledge needed to effectively categorize products by flavor profile. </p>
                            <p><br>This is a critical design insight: the website's product filtering and categorization strategy must account for varying levels of user expertise and provide clear, supportive guidance for less experienced coffee drinkers.</p>

                        <p>Secondary >> Simplified product filter</p>

                        <h3 style="padding-top: 3rem;">Global Navigation</h3>
                        <p>In designing the Global Navigation, I adopted a user-centric approach based on research findings to align with coffee buyers' priorities. Key and distinct services (e.g., subscriptions, wholesale) were separated into dedicated top-level navigation items to ensure precise and immediate user access.</p>
                        <h3 style="padding-top: 3rem;">Secondary Navigation</h3>
                        <p>For Secondary Navigation (specifically product filters), I prioritized a simplified structure. The open card sort revealed that items requiring specific coffee knowledge (like flavor notes) were grouped inconsistently. To address this challenge and maximize accessibility, I streamlined the filters to focus on universally understood attributes like roast level, flavor, and origin. Niche filters, such as preferred brew methods, were initially excluded. This decision effectively balances functionality with simplicity, making product discovery easier for both experienced and novice coffee buyers.</p>

                        <p>This wireframe features an expanded Global Navigation for a highly specific and targeted experience, guiding users directly to the services they need.</p>
                            <p><br>To enhance context awareness, the filter section uses a sticky design that remains visible while scrolling. Applied filter options are kept expanded, ensuring users can always see and easily adjust their selections without losing product context.</p>

                        <h3 style="padding-top: 3rem;">Concept 02</h3>
                        <p>This concept features a simplified Global Navigation structure, mirroring patterns observed in specific competitor websites. This alternative is included to capture complementary data and feedback, providing a necessary contrast to the expanded version during validation.</p>
                        <p><br>The design utilizes a compact, horizontally laid-out dropdown filter interface. This approach is designed to cater to the experienced coffee buyer who does not require persistent filter visibility, thereby dedicating more screen real estate to the product grid for enhanced browsing.</p>
