                        <p>This project showcases the design of the Information Architecture (IA) and a low-fidelity prototype for an online coffee shop.</p>
                        <p><br>The process began with a competitive analysis of existing coffee e-commerce sites to identify common design patterns and user expectations. I then conducted card sorting studies to inform the navigation, translating user mental models into a clear site structure.</p>
                        <p><br>Based on these insights into customer needs and preferences, I developed two wireframe concepts representing different navigation approaches. These concepts served as a foundation for a potential A/B test, with the feedback from both providing complementary insights.</p>
                        <p><br>The final deliverable is a user-centric, accessible website structure that enhances the customer experience for browsing coffee and related products. The project concludes with a detailed design rationale justifying all strategic IA and prototyping choices.</p>

                        <h3>Navigation</h3>
                        <p>Most online coffee retailers rely on a standardized global navigation structure that prioritizes core offerings like coffee, subscriptions, and workshops. Given their frequent collaboration with caf√©s and other retailers, "Wholesale" and "Contact" also consistently feature as high-level navigation categories.</p>

                        </div>
                        
                        <p><br>A two-layer navigation system is a nearly universal design pattern across the analyzed websites. The first layer establishes broad categories, such as Coffee and Coffee Gear, while the second layer provides immediate access to specific subcategories. For instance, Coffee is typically subdivided by flavor and origin, and Coffee Gear includes items like filter paper and milk pitchers.</p>

                        <h3 style="padding-top: 3rem;">Search</h3>
                        <p>Search functionality is consistently present but is narrowly scoped for quick, transactional product retrieval, avoiding unnecessary complexity.</p>

                        <h3 style="padding-top: 3rem;">Display of Navigatio Hierarchy </h3>
                        <p>Finally, the display of the navigation hierarchy varies: some sites employ integrated dropdown menus (e.g., De Mello) for simultaneous access to primary and secondary links, while others use a progressive disclosure model (e.g., Hatch Specialty) where secondary navigation only appears after the primary category is selected.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title-2">Card Sort Study</h2>
                </div>
                    <div style="flex: 1; margin-left: 2rem;">
                        <h3>Methods</h3>
                        <p>I conducted two Card Sorting studies to inform the website's Information Architecture (IA).</p>
                        <p><br>The first was an open sort to establish users' mental models for product classification, guiding the design of secondary categories. The second was a closed sort to validate the global navigation, using eight predefined categories selected through competitive analysis (e.g., Shop Coffee, Subscription, Wholesale). This combined approach ensured both user-driven insights and market alignment for the final structure.</p>
                        <h3 style="padding-top: 3rem;">Result - Open Sort</h3>
                        <p>The study results demonstrated a high level of clarity in user understanding of coffee-related categories. Participants generally sorted cards correctly, confirming the intuitive relationship between the proposed global and secondary navigation items. This suggests that the established categories will enable users to quickly and effectively locate desired products and information.</p>
                        <div class ="image-container">
                            <img src="image/coffee/card-sort.png" alt="card-sort-result-1">
                        </div>
                        <h3 style="padding-top: 3rem;">Result - Closed Sort</h3>
                        <p>The open card sort revealed an area of low consensus regarding the secondary navigation structure. Although the best merge method showed 67% agreement on general categories, flavor-related descriptors (chocolate, bright, fruity, floral) were sorted inconsistently across the user group.</p>
                            <p><br>This inconsistency suggests that a significant portion of the user base (likely those with lower coffee consumption) may lack the coffee knowledge needed to effectively categorize products by flavor profile. </p>
                            <p><br>This is a critical design insight: the website's product filtering and categorization strategy must account for varying levels of user expertise and provide clear, supportive guidance for less experienced coffee drinkers.</p>
