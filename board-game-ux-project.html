                <h3>My Role: Gameplay Designer and User Experience Analyst</h3>
                <br>
                <p>During my third year at the University of Toronto, I co-developed Slasher, a 4-player cooperative board game inspired by haunted house horror. We chose a cooperative format to challenge our design skills, specifically in balancing player experience and difficulty.

                    My contributions focused on gameplay design and user experience (UX) analysis. I helped conduct two user evaluation playtests, using insights to refine mechanics, incorporate randomness for replayability, and balance difficulty. For UX, I addressed accessibility issues like readability, color contrast, and inclusivity to enhance the overall player experience.</p>

                <p>I contributed to gameplay design and user experience analysis, helping conduct two user evaluation playtests that revealed key insights for improvement. Through design iterations, we incorporated elements of randomness to enhance replayability and introduced mechanics that balanced difficulty to keep gameplay engaging. On the UX aspect, I worked on identifying and resolving accessibility issues, such as readability, color contrast, and inclusivity, to improve the overall user experience.</p>

                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The "Slasher" board game project, developed in a UXD board game design class, centers on a cooperative, horror-themed game where players must navigate through a mansion, work together to evade a supernatural slasher, and collect artifacts to exorcise it. The game incorporates strategic and random elements, encouraging collaboration among players while maintaining suspense and unpredictability.</p>

            <div class="project-section">
                <h3>Design Process</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The initial design started with a low-fidelity prototype hand-drawn on A4 sheets, focusing on basic gameplay mechanics and player roles. Each player had unique abilities, and the game was driven by dice rolls to dictate the slasher's movements and trigger room-based disasters. The design emphasized cooperative gameplay, with players needing to pool resources and strategize effectively to win.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Feedback from the first round of user testing highlighted the need for clearer rules and a more intuitive game structure. The team addressed these issues by developing a high-fidelity prototype that included graphical design aligned with the slasher theme and a comprehensive rulebook. The gameplay mechanics were refined to make action cards more accessible and user-friendly, balancing the cognitive load required to play.</p>

                <br>
                   
                
                <p><strong>First Session (Low-Fidelity Prototype):</strong> Conducted with participants aged 21â€“22, this session revealed that while the game was perceived as collaborative, users struggled to play without facilitator guidance due to unclear rules. Players were hesitant to use action cards, indicating the need for simplification and better instruction.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Second Session (High-Fidelity Prototype):</strong> This iteration involved more diverse participants and tested the usability of the rulebook. While players better understood the general rules, specific details remained confusing, and reading through the lengthy rulebook took significant time. Feedback also noted the importance of clearer visual aids and rulebook improvements.</p>

                <h3>Iteration Process</h3>
                <ul class="iteration-list">
                    <li><strong>Rulebook Revisions:</strong> Shifted from dense information to a step-by-step structure. A simplified "Quick Start Guide" was introduced for ease of learning the game rules.</li>
                    <li><strong>Visual Cues:</strong> Added art and clearer visual indicators to the board to aid players in understanding gameplay and movement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Action Card Use:</strong> Simplified the mechanics so that using action cards no longer required one of the limited player actions. This change aimed to make gameplay faster and more engaging.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clarified Card Functions:</strong> Differentiated and simplified passive and active action cards to avoid confusion, specifically for cards like "Armor" and "Hide."</li>
                    <li><strong>Visual Enhancements:</strong> Added thematic elements and refined the board's layout to align with the horror theme, making gameplay more engaging.</li>
                    <li><strong>Balancing Gameplay:</strong> Tweaked player abilities and action card effects to ensure that roles like the Babysitter were not overwhelmingly advantageous and that all characters had impactful strategic contributions.</li>

                <h3>Key Outcomes</h3>
                <ul class="outcomes-list">
                    <li><strong>Enhanced Gameplay and Engagement:</strong> Iterative testing and revisions made the "Slasher" board game more collaborative and enjoyable, with a strong theme that players found immersive. The cooperative elements and strategic gameplay were well-received.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rulebook and Instructional Adjustments:</strong> While the addition of a "Quick Start Guide" improved onboarding, the comprehensive rulebook was still complex, presenting a learning curve for new players. Simplifying the rules further could enhance clarity and ease of play.</li>
                    <li><strong>Balanced Game Mechanics:</strong> Revisions to action cards and player abilities improved gameplay balance, ensuring strategic and exciting sessions. Clarifications made action cards more accessible, contributing to a smoother pace.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collaborative Success:</strong> Changes encouraged active teamwork, aligning with the game's core goal. Players became more strategic once they understood the game, underscoring the importance of clear initial instructions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Positive Theme Reception:</strong> The horror theme effectively reinforced gameplay mechanics and was well-received, adding to player enjoyment.</li>
